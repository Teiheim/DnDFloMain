## How to set up your local

### Prerequisites
First, you will have to have the following installed on your machine:
- Pip
- Pipenv (which includes virtualenv) for dependency management. [Installation instructions](https://realpython.com/pipenv-guide/)
- Git
- PostgreSQL **(Edit this when we decide which DB we want to use)**
- Python Django Official Release. Just run `pip install django`
- Atom IDE **(Edit this when we decide which IDE we want to use)**

### Steps for local setup
1. First, clone this repository wherever you want to keep your local project files
2. Set up your local database
3. ???
4. Test it works by navigating to _insert localhost address here_

### 1. Clone the repository
- To do this step, you must first have an SSH key set up for your GitHub account and the machine you are working on. [Instructions here](https://help.github.com/en/enterprise/2.15/user/articles/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent). You can also do this using cloning with HTTPS instead of SSH but SSH will be much more convenient for you every time you try to pull and push code moving forward :o
- On the [main page](https://github.com/Teiheim/DnDFloMain) of this repository, click the green button that says "Clone or Download." Copy the link in the pane that says "Clone with SSH."
- Then, open your terminal and navigate to where you want your project folder to be, and type `git clone {clone url}`, but paste the SSH link where `{clone url}` is. Hit enter, and this should pull all the files from this GitHub repo to your local machine :)

### 2. Set up your local database
